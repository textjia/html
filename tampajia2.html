                  Treasure Island also offers a wider variety of water sports and activities.

                  Finally, Treasure Island is a great spot for those who enjoy nightlife, but also want a more relaxed atmosphere. It has a variety of bars and restaurants that offer live music and entertainment, but they are more low-key and casual than the ones in Clearwater or St Pete Beach.<br><br>
                  
                  In summary, Treasure Island offers a unique and different beach experience, with a quiet and laid-back atmosphere, an Old Florida charm, a wide variety of water sports and activities, and a relaxed nightlife scene.</LI>
